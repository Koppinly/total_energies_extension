Written as a solution for Total Energies. 
This was designed to address an issue where the Optimizely Visual Editor was not allowing a button to be clicked as the editor was wrapping the button in a single change. 
In the interest of reusing the HTML block in various experiments, I've created an Optimizely Extension that allows you to insert it as needed.

Steps to Implement

Locate the total_energies.json file provided in this repo.
Copy the JSON file.
Visit Implementation -> Extensions (Tab) --> Create New Extension --> Using JSON
Paste the JSON in the field and save
In the Extensions menu, click the Three Dots associated with Total Energies, and click Enable.
The Extension is now available in the Visual Editor panel for each experiment.
